# Tic Tac Toe

A simple, console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in Python — two players take turns marking a 3×3 grid. Minimal, beginner-friendly code you can run and study.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akash-bhaduri/tic-tac-toe
cd tic-tac-toe
```

2. Run the game (replace `main.py` with the actual script name if different):

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (no external libraries required)

## How to play

- Two players alternate turns.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your move (usually a cell number or row/column).
- The game shows the board and announces a win or draw when the game ends.

## Why this repo

- Great for learning control flow, basic I/O, and game logic.
- Clean, readable code — ideal as a first small project or demo for a portfolio.
